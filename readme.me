# Monopoly Game tickets - show me the winners!

A python project to record all of the ticket numbers and determine if we have a full set 
and win a prize!  

Ticket prizes are identified by the first 2 characters on the ticket, plus a 1 character alpha 
character for a total of 4-7 tickets needed to win one prize.
